# Student-Attendance-Record-System
Group Coursework

The system also provides individual attendance records and attendance statistics to tutors, managers and admin staff within the school. Students can only see their own attendance record by logging onto the system. Finally, the system should provide a hyperlinked version of a register with links to other information on each system coming from the central AIS system, such as registration status, holds, student photograph, programme name and a list of courses the student is officially registered on.
